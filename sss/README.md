##Ideology
- a function to calculate the the final f(0) = as the yj*lj.
- a stuct to store the points - x and y coordinate
- main - to input the S, N and K as an CLI input , we'll be using parser
- func - compute the lagrange fraction
- use rand() - to generate the random no for the coefficients
- func - to iterate through and find the langrange terms
- input the numbers that are needed to get the points and check which ones will we be considering here
