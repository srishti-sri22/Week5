## Ideology

Step 1 : take the secret , the number and the desired k shares from the user using clap via cli parsing. A stuct to store the points - x and y coordinate. main - to input the S, N and K as an CLI input , we'll be using parser

Step 2 : lets consider that the secret.
Now let's take the given string and convert it into bytes and then decimal and vice versa to be able to do anything i mean any claculation on it.


- a function to calculate the the final f(0) = as the yj*lj.
-
- func - compute the lagrange fraction
- use rand() - to generate the random no for the coefficients
- func - to iterate through and find the langrange terms
- input the numbers that are needed to get the points and check which ones will we be considering here
